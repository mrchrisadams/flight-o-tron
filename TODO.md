- [x] Get the carbonkit service working when we add two cities /IATA codes
- [ ] Add a delete button for removing flights
- [ ] Work out how to persist flights somewhere (url? local storage? dexiejs?)
- [ ] Add basic styling, once we know making reqs and getting numbers back in a browser can work ok
